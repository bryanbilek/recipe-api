# recipe-api
- This is the backend for an app about viewing and creating recipes.
- To build this api, I used Node.Js, Express, and MongoDB (using Mongoose).
- There is full CRUD for recipes & authentication using jsonwebtoken for users.
- Every other route is built switching between promises using .then/.catch or async/await with a try/catch.
- This was deployed to Heroku to be used in combination with another repo where I'll build the frontend of the recipe app using JavaScript & React.
